# Digital Clock
!(digital.clock)[dch]

Creating a digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a fun and educational project that helped me understand the basics 
of web development and dynamic content manipulation. The digital clock will display the current time and update every second, 
providing a live timekeeping feature on a webpage.

# Html
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) serves as the foundational structure for building a digital clock on a webpage.
In this project, HTML is used to create the essential elements needed to display the time.
HTML can include meta tags for character set and viewport settings to ensure proper rendering across different devices.
By providing the basic skeleton, HTML allows developers to embed the clock within a web page seamlessly and interact with 
other web technologies like CSS and JavaScript to create an aesthetically pleasing and functional digital clock.

# CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is crucial in building a digital clock as it defines the visual presentation of the clock, 
enhancing its aesthetic appeal and usability.
